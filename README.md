## ABOUT ME

My name is Lingjie Wang. I have just graduated with a Master’s degree in Statistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in May. Currently I am seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst/Data Scientist. 

I have a solid background in data analysis. With a deep understanding in Statistical theories, I have also completed several data analysis projects applying statistical methods in R and Python with very large datasets. These projects involve several parts of data analysis such as large data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, regression (machine learning), data mining, data visualization and and data manipulation with SQL. 

For statistical analysis projects conducted in R and Python, I’ve conducted statistical consulting tasks for EPA Air Quality Analysis Group, including creating scatterplots, boxplots and correlation matrix heatmap in R, and also hypothesis testing and other exploratory analysis. I've also conducted analysis involves unsupervised learning methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) for authorship identification and analysis with PCA and clustering methods (k-means, etc.) on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data to find clusters. Moreover, I’ve completed a project of sentiment analysis on classification of 4000 movie reviews using supervised learning method Support Vector Machine method with 3 different kernels in LightSIDE and python. More for Python, I’ve completed a data analysis project on filtering and visualizing data of medals of all the Winter/Summer Olympic Games, which ranked as one of the best course project in class.

For data visualization, I’ve preprocessed 1G&1.7G raw data files in R and created network visualization of 100 artists in Gephi in 2016 ASA Datafest competition. I’ve also filtered and cleaned crime and population data of 51 states from Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau, and presented exploratory and correlation analysis on crimes and locations in Tableau. I have also created scatterplots, boxplots, correlation heatmaps and spatial maps on concentration and hourly NowCast AQI in R & Tableau.
