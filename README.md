# Lingjie (Claire) Wang's Data Science Portfolio

My name is Lingjie Wang. I have just graduated with a Master’s degree in Statistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in May. Currently I am seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst/Data Scientist. 

I have a solid background in data analysis. With a deep understanding in Statistical theories, I have also completed several data analysis projects applying statistical methods in **R** and **Python** with very large datasets. These projects involve several parts of data analysis such as large data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, regression (machine learning), data mining, data visualization and and data manipulation with **SQL**. 

## MORE ABOUT ME
For statistical analysis projects conducted in **R**, I’ve conducted statistical consulting tasks for EPA Air Quality Analysis Group, including creating scatterplots, boxplots and correlation matrix heatmap in R, and also hypothesis testing and other exploratory analysis. I've also conducted analysis involves unsupervised learning methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) for authorship identification and analysis with PCA and clustering methods (k-means, etc.) on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data to find clusters. 

In **Python**, I’ve completed a project of sentiment classification on IMDb Movie reviews. I have used Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression and SVM classifiers and applied Bag-of-Words model and TF-IDF methods for feature extraction, and reduced test error to 0.15 using Logistic Regression and SVM (linear kernel) classifiers and TF-IDF. I’ve also completed a data analysis project on filtering and visualizing data (matplotlib) of medals of all the Winter/Summer Olympic Games , which ranked as one of the best course project in class.

For other **data visualization project** in R, **Tableau** and Gephi, I’ve preprocessed 1G&1.7G raw data files in R and created network visualization of 100 artists in Gephi in 2016 ASA Datafest competition. I’ve also filtered and cleaned crime and population data of 51 states from Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau, and presented exploratory and correlation analysis on crimes and locations in Tableau. I have also created scatterplots, boxplots, correlation heatmaps and spatial maps on concentration and hourly NowCast AQI in R and Tableau.

## PROJECTS
- [Sentiment Classification Analysis On IMDb Movie Reviews](https://github.com/clairewlj/Sentiment-Analysis)<br />May 2017
  
  Used Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression and SVM (RBF/linear kernel) classifiers to conduct positive/negative sentiment classification on IMDb movie reviews in Python. Applied Bag-of-Words model and TF-IDF methods for feature extraction. Reduced test error to 0.15 using Logistic Regression and SVM (linear kernel) classifiers and TF-IDF.

- [Air Quality Analysis: Readings From EPA and Federal Monitors](https://github.com/clairewlj/clairewlj.github.io/tree/master/Projects/EPA%20Air%20Quality%20Analysis)<br />Sept. 2016 – May 2017
  
  Performed hypothesis testing, helped EPA Air Quality Analysis Group evaluate performance of EPA monitors and found hourly averages of EPA VG data were lower than Federal data. Applied Box-cox data transformation on non-normally distributed data, and performed t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Conducted correlation analysis on air quality/geographical data in R. Cleaned 1 million PM2.5 and Ozone concentration data and detected outliers.

- [Analysis on Google Ads for Online Ticket Sale, ASA Datafest](https://github.com/clairewlj/clairewlj.github.io/tree/master/Projects/ASA%20DataFest)<br />Apr. 2016
  
  Conducted network analysis to find clusters of most connected artists to improve ads push efficiency. Created network visualizations in Gephi and R. Developed a multivariate linear regression model and found quality and order of ads to be influential factors for ads effectiveness. Cleaned and merged over 3GB ticket sale and user data from TicketMaster. 

- [Python Olympic Games Medals Data Analysis And Visualization](https://github.com/clairewlj/Python-Olympic-Games-Medals-Data-Analysis-And-Visualization)<br />Mar. 2016 - Apr. 2016
  
  Developed a program for users to select multiple filters and view summer/winter Olympic Games medals data, including medals details and counts, rankings of ROC in selected years and visualizations of top 10 NOC winning total /gold /silver / bronze medals.

- [Comparative Analysis on Endogeneity Testing Methods in Bi-Probit Model](https://github.com/clairewlj/clairewlj.github.io/tree/master/Projects/Endogeneity%20Testing)<br />Jan. 2015 – June 2015

  Conducted simulations for bivariate probit model applying Monte Carlo method in STATA. Compared empirical power and empirical size of Likelihood Ratio/Wald test on endogeneity. Fitted bi-probit models for married Chinese women’s two decisions of going out to work and caring for parents at home, and found endogeneity in the model.

- [Empirical Analysis on Wealth Effect of Family Assets on Consumption](https://github.com/clairewlj/clairewlj.github.io/tree/master/Projects/Wealth%20Effect)<br />Apr. 2014 – Aug. 2014
  
  Fitted multivariate linear regression models on household consumption against family assets based on 2011 CHFS data in STATA. Decomposed R-square by Shapley Value Decomposition method, and discovered the most significant variables to be non-financial assets.

## OTHER EXPERIENCES
- Computer Tech Team Volunteer, The WiderNet Project<br />Oct. 2016 – Dec. 2016
  
  Performed data collection and cleaning in SQL. Used text mining tool Exiftool to extract metadata from pdf/image/video files, conducted data manipulation in Postgres Database.
  
- Business Intern, Guokr Interactive Technology Media Co Ltd<br />Aug. 2014 – Oct. 2014

  Wrote and translated advertising articles and posts, designed sidebars for Intel, Qualcomm, Extra and Jaeger-LeCoultre. Managed posts for Qualcomm mobile accessory design competition. Conducted exploratory analysis on views, comments and reposts about advertising events for Kindle Fire HDX and GSK Parodontax on 3 websites, and completed case analysis statements.
